      <p>Hello, my name is Leslie Morales. I am currently a third year at CSU East Bay majoring in Computer Science residing in Hayward, CA. I'm majoring in computer science because I am passionate about front-end development.
      I believe that design is an important element in everything, but especially feel strongly about graphic design and user interfaces. Good design is appealing to the eye,
      easy to use, and could potentially be the driver in keeping a user.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>I currently work as a graphic designer at CSU East Bay's Diversity and Inclusion Student center. I enjoy being able to create content that promotes educational events on social-justice
        oriented events. I think it's important for people to come to such events so they can learn more about eachother, their identities, the society we live in, and the problems we face.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
      <p>In my spare time, I really enjoy drawing, playing video games, listening to music, and practicing cello. I'm also an avid fan of animated series so when I have the time I like to catch up on my favorites or start a new one.</p>
